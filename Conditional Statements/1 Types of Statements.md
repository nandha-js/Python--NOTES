📘 **Topic: Types of Statements in Python**

A **statement** is an instruction that Python can execute.  
Every line of code that performs an action is a statement. ⚙️

### 🧩 Major Types of Statements:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Expression Statement** | Produces a value or output. | `x + y`, `print("Hello")` |
| **Assignment Statement** | Assigns a value to a variable. | `x = 10` |
| **Conditional Statement** | Used for decision-making. | `if`, `elif`, `else` |
| **Looping Statement** | Repeats a block of code. | `for`, `while` |
| **Jump Statement** | Alters normal flow of execution. | `break`, `continue`, `pass` |
| **Function / Class Definition** | Defines a function or class. | `def`, `class` |
| **Import Statement** | Brings external modules into the code. | `import math` |

### 🧩 Example
x = 10
y = 5

if x > y:                # Conditional statement  
    print("x is greater")  # Expression statement

for i in range(3):        # Looping statement  
    print(i)

💡 **Tip:**  
All Python programs are made up of **statements** — from variable assignments to function definitions.
