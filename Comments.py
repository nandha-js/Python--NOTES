📘 Topic: Comments in Python

Comments are notes for humans, not for Python.

Python ignores comments while running the code.


🧩 Types of Comments:

Single-line comment: starts with #

"""

#🧩 Multi-line comment: use ''' ... ''' or """ ... """
'''
This is a
multi-line comment
'''
print("Python")

#💡 Tip: Use comments to explain your code clearly!
