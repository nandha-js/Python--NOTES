# Brief History of Python

Created by: <mark> Guido van Rossum 🇳🇱 (Dutch programmer) </mark>

Year: *Late 1980s* , **officially released in 1991**

Developed at: Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands

Named after: "Monty Python’s Flying Circus", **a British comedy show — not the snake** 🐍

**🕰️ Python Versions:**

Python 1.0 (1991): First release — basic features like functions & modules.

Python 2.0 (2000): Added garbage collection & Unicode support.

Python 3.0 (2008): Major upgrade — cleaner syntax, not backward compatible with Python 2.

**✨ Fun Fact:**
Guido wanted a language that’s simple, readable, and powerful — combining the best parts of C and ABC (an older teaching language).
