# Heading: Escape Sequences in Python

### Syntax: "string with escape sequences"

# 🔍 Breakdown
# Escape sequences start with a backslash (\) to represent special characters in strings.

# 💻 Common Escape Sequences
# | Sequence | Meaning      | Example                   | Output           |
# | -------- | ------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
# | \n       | New line     | print("Hello\nWorld")     | Hello          <br> World |
# | \t       | Tab space    | print("A\tB")             | A B              |
# | \\       | Backslash    | print("C:\\path")         | C:\path          |
# | \"       | Double quote | print("He said \"Hi\"")   | He said "Hi"     |
# | \'       | Single quote | print('It\'s OK')         | It's OK          |

# 💡 Tip
# Use raw strings with r"string" to ignore escape sequences:
print(r"Hello\nWorld")   # Output: Hello\nWorld

# ✅ In Short
# Escape sequences allow you to include special characters like newline, tab, quotes, and backslash in strings.
