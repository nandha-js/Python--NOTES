# Heading: Relational Operators in Python

### Syntax: a <operator> b

# 🔍 Breakdown
# Used to compare two values (also called comparison operators).
# Always returns True or False ✅❌

# 💻 Common Relational Operators
# | Operator | Meaning                  | Example  | Result  |
# | -------- | ------------------------ | -------- | ------- |
# | ==       | Equal to                 | 5 == 5   | True    |
# | !=       | Not equal to             | 5 != 3   | True    |
# | >        | Greater than             | 10 > 5   | True    |
# | <        | Less than                | 2 < 8    | True    |
# | >=       | Greater than or equal to | 5 >= 5   | True    |
# | <=       | Less than or equal to    | 3 <= 2   | False   |

# 💻 Examples
x = 10
y = 20

print(x > y)    # Output: False
print(x <= y)   # Output: True
print(x == 10)  # Output: True

# 💡 Tip
# Mostly used in if conditions and loops to check logic.

# ✅ In Short
# Relational operators compare values and return a Boolean result.
